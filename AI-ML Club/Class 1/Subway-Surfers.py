#How to play:
#1. Right hand controls changing lanes 
#2. Left hand controls jumping and rolling
#3. You cant use your fancy boards or headstarts yet.
#
#Right hand Controls:
#a. Open hand means changing to right and closed means changing to left.
#b. If you changed to lane once and wish to move in that direction again, just close and open your thumb once again.

#Left hand Controls:
#a. Open hand means jump and closed hand means roll.
#b. If you jump once or roll once and want same action again, just hide and show your thumb again.

#Some Tips
#a. Basic control of the game was Open hand and close hand and thumb is a action repeater.
#b. Always show your thumb as it keeps your controls in a neutral position.
#c. At starting Show both hand open in a upfront position(Thumbs towards middle).

#Notes
#1. If you want some changes for control mapping like Right hand controls changing lane to right ad jump and Left hand controlling
#   changing to left and rolling, suggest it to me please.
